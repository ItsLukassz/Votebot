# VoteBot

This is a test program to learn selenium using proxies and trying to solve captcha using extensions

This is used for m-craft.lt voting site to boost your server votes

## Issues

1. Cant fully implement rotating proxies into the code because i do not have private proxies
2. Solving captcha is buggy and doesnt work all the time because of buster having limits

## How to use

Steps to run this project:
1. Update chrome webdriver to match your chrome version in src/webdriver
2. Change the link Variable to your servers voting page 
3. Buy or use Tor's rotating proxies and make sure they are running (private proxies work best)
4. Run
5. Enjoy
